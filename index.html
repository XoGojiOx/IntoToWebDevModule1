    <h1>Who I Am!</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        My name is Richard Sanders and I'm an inspiring Web Developer! I have
        been worked in the wireless industry since 2010. I've held positions
        ranging from Sales Assocaite thru Market Director. I knew for a long
        time that I wanted to get into tech and decided that now is the time to
        make the move!
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a job as an IT Analyst with a local school disctrict and started
        taking classes at WSU Tech. I've also been taking a class through Udemy
        which I've been told many new Web Developers take. It's a lot of time
        studying, but it will pay off in the end!
