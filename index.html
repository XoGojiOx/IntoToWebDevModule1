      <h1>Who I Am?!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Richard Sanders and I'm an inspiring Web Developer! I worked
        in the wireless industry since 2010. I've held positions ranging from
        Sales Assocaite thru Market Director. I knew for a long time that I
        wanted to get into tech and decided that now is the time to make the
        move!
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a job as an IT Analyst with a local school disctrict and started
        taking classes at WSU Tech. I've also been taking a class through Udemy
        which I've been told many new Web Developers take. It's a lot of time
        studying, but it will pay off in the end!

      <h2>More About Me!</h2>
      <p>
        After a car wreck 3 years ago, my life changed. What I once found
        important, I no longer do. I put value on my family above all else and
        strive each day to be the best husband and father I can. I'll share a
        few things that I enjoy each day!

      <h3>My Family!</h3>
      <p>
        My wife Amanda is amazing! We have been together for 12 years, married
        for 8 of them. We have one child named Max. Max is 8 years old and is so
        incredible!

      <h3>Our Homestead!</h3>
      <p>
        My family and I live on 40 acres an hour west of Wichita. The drive is
        long into Wichita, but it is so worth it! Between the creek that runs
        through the middle of our land to the trees and pond filled with fish
        and brids... it's our slice of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have many animlas that are part of our little family. We have geese,
        ducks, chickens, 3 dogs, two cats, and a grump rabbit......
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a quick bio about me! I'm excited to be here in this class and I
        look forward to learning more about web development and hopefully take
        my first step into the web development as a career soon!
